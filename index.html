        <h2>Discovering Wisdom in Nature</h2>
        <p>Nature is man's teacher.    
            She unfolds her treasure to his search,   
            unseals his eye, illumes his mind,    
            and purifies his heart;     
            an influence breathes from all the sights and sounds    
            of her existence. Believe one who knows: you will find something greater in woods than in books.  Trees and stones will teach you that which you can never learn from masters. If there is any wisdom running through my life now, in my walking on this earth, it came from listening in the Great Silence to the stones, trees, space, the wild animals, to the pulse of all life as my heartbeat. There is in all visible things an invisible fecundity, a dimmed light, a meek namelessness, a hidden wholeness.  This mysterious unity and integrity is wisdom, the mother of us all, "natura naturans."  There is in all things an inexhaustible sweetness and purity, a silence that is a fountain of action and joy.  It rises up in wordless gentleness, and flows out to me from the unseen roots of all created being.</p>

        <h2>Exploring Our Relationship With Nature</h2>
        <p>Man is not himself only...He is all that he sees; all that flows to him from a thousand sources...He is the land, the lift of its mountain lines, the reach of its valleys. We inter-breath with the rain forests, we drink from the oceans.  They are part of our own body. You didn't come into this world.  You came out of it, like a wave from the ocean.  You are not a stranger here. These are brand-new birds of   
            twelve-months' growing,  
            Which a year ago, or less than twain,   
            No finches were, nor nightingales,  
            Nor thrushes,     
            But only particles of grain,   
            And earth and air, and rain. One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.</p>

        <h2>Experiencing Joy in Nature</h2>
        <p>What a joy it is to feel the soft, springy earth under my feet once more,    
            to follow grassy roads that lead to ferny brooks    
            where I can bathe my fingers in a cataract of rippling notes,    
            or to clamber over a stone wall into green fields that    
            tumble and roll and climb in riotous gladness! In those vernal seasons of the year, when the air is calm and pleasant, it were an injury and sullenness against Nature not to go out and see her riches, and partake in her rejoicing with heaven and earth.i thank You God for most this amazing
            day: for the leaping greenly spirits of trees
            and a blue true dream of sky; and for everything
            which is natural which is infinite which is yes.....Go out, go out I beg of you    
            And taste the beauty of the wild.    
            Behold the miracle of the earth    
            With all the wonder of a child.</p>
